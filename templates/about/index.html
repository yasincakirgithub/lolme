        <div class="overview" style="line-height: 1.5;">
            As a Shaco one trick pony, I know better than most how useful it is to find an opponent on tilt. At the
            beginning of Season 7, I began my climb with a goal to hit gold for the first time by myself playing Solo
            Queue truly solo. I used every advantage I could, scouring all the usual websites for data on my opponents.
            In my search, I discovered the power of data. However, while many of the websites looked pretty and had
            intriguing stats, I found that none of them offered what I truly wanted. A simple and straightforward data
            driven competitive advantage.
            <br>
            <br>
            With nothing available able to meet my needs, I went to work building the first iteration of Tiltseeker as a
            simple python script. It ran in the command line and while it certainly didn't look pretty, it made up for
            its appearance with usefulness. I climbed faster than I could have hoped easily peaking at Gold 3 with
            plenty of time to spare before the season ended. By continuing to utilize the computational power of
            Tiltseeker, I have further optimized my jungling playstyle and climbed to Platinum 5 less than half way
            through Season 8.
            <br>
            <br>
            While Tiltseeker doesn't guarantee wins, it allows a user to optimize their gameplay by camping the lanes
            that will most benefit from a jungler's attention. As a result, a Tiltseeker user can expect their average
            winrate to increase and their MRR to climb.
